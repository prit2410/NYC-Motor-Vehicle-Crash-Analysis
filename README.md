# NYC-Motor-Vehicle-Crash-Analysis

This project analyzes motor vehicle collisions in New York City using a dataset containing crash records. The analysis explores crash patterns by time of day, contributing factors, borough distribution, vehicle types, and severity. It includes data cleaning, statistical summaries, visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib, and geospatial mapping with Folium. The project also investigates the impact of COVID-19 on crash rates and provides insights for improving road safety and urban planning.
